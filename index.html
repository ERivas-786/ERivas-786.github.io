            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello there! My Name is Emanuel Rivas and I am a Computer Engineering student at Florida International University(FIU). I was born in Barranquilla, Colombia and I am 
                currently working towards obtaining my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering by Fall 2022. Whenever I am not studying or practicing my programming skills, my hobbies consist 
                playing video games, sports, listening to music, as well as spending time with friends and family.
